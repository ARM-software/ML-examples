## GitHub Action Workflows

The [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) in the directory `.github/workflows` are the scripts for the CI tests. These scripts contain detailed comments about each step that is executed.

These examples use the [ArmÂ® Compiler for Embedded](https://developer.arm.com/Tools%20and%20Software/Arm%20Compiler%20for%20Embedded) (AC6) toolchain. As such all workflows are using this compiler.

- `AVH-FVP-CI.yml` implements the *AVH build and execution test* that runs on [Arm Virtual Hardware - Fixed Virtual Platforms (AVH FVP)](https://arm-software.github.io/AVH/main/simulation/html/index.html) simulation models. The directory `FVP` contains configuration files for the FVP simulation models.

- `Hardware-CI.yml` implmentes the *Hardware build test* that runs on evaluation boards. The output of this build test is stored as artifacts and can be downloaded to the evaluation board for execution.
