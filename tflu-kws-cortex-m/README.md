# Deprecation notice

This repository is now deprecated and the code previously contained here has been moved to other places.

To find the models along with code to recreate and evaluate them please visit the Arm ML-Zoo [here](https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-zoo/tree/master/models/keyword_spotting)
where you will find new model packages that contain all the relevant models and code that were previously contained here.

To deploy the Keyword spotting models to Microcontrollers, including virtual targets, please now refer to our new code
[here](https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-examples/tree/main/cmsis-pack-examples)
where we have made deployment even easier.
