# Building and Running the Audio Generation Application on Arm® CPUs with the Stable Audio Open Small Model

Welcome to the home of audio generation on Arm® CPUs, featuring Stable Audio Open Small with Arm® KleidiAI™. This project provides everything you need to:

- Convert models to LiteRT-compatible formats
- Run these models on Arm® CPUs using the LiteRT runtime, with support from XNNPack and Arm® KleidiAI™

## Prerequisites

- Experience with Arm® cross-compilation on Android™ or Linux®, or macOS®
- Proficiency with Android™ shell commands
- An Android™ mobile phone or platform with an Arm® CPU with at least <strong>FEAT_DotProd</strong> (dotprod) and optionally <strong>FEAT_I8MM</strong> (i8mm) feature.
- Minimum device RAM requirement: 8GB.

## Introduction
![Stable Audio Open Model](./model.png?raw=true "Stable Audio Open Model")

The Stable Audio Open Small Model is made of three submodules: Conditioners (Text conditioner and number conditioners), a diffusion transformer (DiT), and an AutoEncoder:
* Conditioners: Consist of T5-based text encoder for the input prompt and a number conditioner for total seconds input. The conditioners encode the inputs into numerical values to be passed to DiT model.
* Diffusion transformer (DiT): It takes a random noise, and denoises it through a defined number of steps, to resemble what the conditioners intent.
* AutoEncoder: It compresses the input waveforms into a manageable sequence length to be processed by the DiT model. At the end of de-noising step, it decompresses the result into a waveform.

## Setup

### Step 1
Clone this repository in your terminal, then navigate to `kleidiai-examples/audiogen/` directory.

### Step 2
Create a workspace directory for managing the dependencies and repositories. Export the WORKSPACE variable to point to this directory, which you will use in the following steps:
```bash
mkdir my-workspace
export WORKSPACE=$PWD/my-workspace
```

### Step 3
Download the Stable Audio Open Small Model. The model is open-source and optimized for generating short audio samples, sound effects, and production elements using text prompts.

Login to HuggingFace and navigate to the model landing page: [https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-small/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-audio-open-small/tree/main)

Download and copy the configuration file `model_config.json` and the model itself, `model.ckpt`, to your workspace directory, and verify they exist by running the command:
```bash
ls $WORKSPACE/model_config.json $WORKSPACE/model.ckpt
```

## Part 1 - Converting the submodules to LiteRT format
The instructions to convert the three submodules of the Stable Audio Open Small Model to LiteRT format are detailed in the [README.md](./scripts/README.md) file in the `scripts/` folder.

## Part 2 - Build instructions
The instructions to build the audio generation application to run on Android™ are detailed in the [README.md](./app/README.md) file in the `app/` folder. Instructions are valid for both Linux® and macOS® systems.
